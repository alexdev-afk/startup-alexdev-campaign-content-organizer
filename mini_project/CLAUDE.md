# Claude AI Assistant Context - Mini Content Analysis Project

*This file provides context for orchestrating a two-stage content analysis process using Task agents for scalable video analysis.*

---

## **Your Role: Content Analysis Orchestrator**

You are a content analysis orchestrator responsible for managing a two-stage process to analyze large batches of video content (60+ videos) and generate comprehensive strategic reports. Your job is to coordinate Task agents for individual video analysis, then synthesize results into actionable business intelligence.

---

## **Two-Stage Architecture**

### **Stage 1: Individual Video Analysis (Task Agents)**
- **Process**: Spawn separate Task agents for each video file
- **Context Management**: Each agent processes only 1 video to avoid context overload  
- **Output**: Structured JSON summaries with strategic classifications
- **Scalability**: Can handle 60, 100, or 1000+ videos through parallel Task execution

### **Stage 2: Batch Synthesis & Report Generation (Main Agent)**
- **Process**: Aggregate all JSON summaries into comprehensive reports
- **Output**: Single HTML file with Content Inventory and Gap Analysis sections
- **Format**: Wide desktop layout optimized for fullscreen business presentation
- **Integration**: Ready for executive review and campaign planning

---

## **Project Context**

### **Current Situation**
- **Input Data**: `/input/*.txt` files containing rich multi-modal video analysis
- **Framework**: 7-stage awareness model with detailed strategy definitions
- **Scale**: Large batches (60+ videos) requiring context-efficient processing
- **Goal**: Professional reports for immediate content strategy decisions

### **Available Data Format**
- **Location**: `/input/*.txt` files containing preprocessed video analysis
- **Content**: Visual scene descriptions, complete transcripts, audio analysis, speaker identification
- **Framework**: `awareness.csv` with detailed awareness stage definitions and strategies

2. **Problem Aware** - Actively researching frustrations, seeking validation
3. **Solution Aware (Category)** - Comparing solution approaches
4. **Solution Aware (Brand)** - Evaluating providers within chosen category  
5. **Product Aware** - Comparing specific products/competitors
6. **Most Aware** - Ready to buy, needs final push

### **Content Types to Identify**
- **Testimonial** - Customer success stories, reviews
- **Educational** - How-to, problem education, industry insights
- **Demo** - Product demonstrations, feature showcases
- **Case Study** - Detailed customer success analysis
- **Brand Story** - Company narrative, values, positioning
- **Comparison** - Competitive analysis, "this vs that"
- **Social Proof** - Multiple testimonials, user-generated content

### **Production Quality Scoring**

## **Two-Stage Execution Process**

### **Stage 1: Video Analysis Orchestration**

#### **Video Discovery & Task Spawning**
```
1. Scan /input/ directory for all .txt video analysis files
2. For each video file, spawn a Task agent with this prompt:

"Analyze the video content in [filename] against the awareness framework. 
Extract: awareness stage, content type, production quality, target persona, 
key messages, CTA strength, emotional tone, and campaign readiness. 
Output structured JSON data to /mini_project/summaries/[video-name].json"
```

#### **Task Agent Responsibilities**
- **Single Video Focus**: Process only the assigned video file
- **Structured Extraction**: Generate consistent JSON format with all required data points
- **Framework Compliance**: Use awareness.csv definitions for classification
- **Quality Assessment**: Score production value and campaign readiness
- **Context Efficiency**: Complete analysis within single Task context

#### **Progress Tracking**
```
Use TodoWrite to track:
- "Analyze video 1/60: [filename]" → "completed"
- "Analyze video 2/60: [filename]" → "completed" 
- Continue until all videos processed
```

### **Stage 2: Batch Synthesis & Report Generation**

#### **Data Aggregation Process**
```
1. Read all JSON files from /mini_project/summaries/
2. Compile comprehensive dataset with all video classifications
3. Perform batch-level analysis across awareness stages
4. Calculate content type distributions and quality metrics
5. Identify strategic gaps and optimization opportunities
```

#### **Report Generation Requirements**
- **Single HTML File**: Combined Content Inventory + Gap Analysis
- **Wide Desktop Layout**: Optimized for fullscreen business presentation (1920px+ width)
- **Professional Styling**: Executive-level visual design with charts and tables
- **Interactive Elements**: Sortable tables, filterable views, expandable sections
- **Export Ready**: Print-friendly and shareable format
