## **Copy Decisions: Proven Patterns Adopted**

### **1. Multi-Agent System Architecture (Simplified for Local)**
**Decision**: Adopt multi-agent approach optimized for Claude Code local execution
- **Orchestrator Agent**: Main Claude instance managing workflow
- **Parallel Classification**: Sequential processing of taxonomy dimensions  
- **Quality Assurance**: Built-in validation within same process
- **Rationale**: Research shows 90.2% performance improvement with multi-agent systems
- **Trade-off**: Simplified vs true parallel agents for local reliability

### **2. Enterprise Taxonomy Framework**
**Decision**: Implement proven 4-core dimension taxonomy with 25 extended dimensions
- **Core Taxonomy**: Journey Stage × Persona × Content Type × Format
- **Extended Intelligence**: 29 total dimensions capturing comprehensive business intelligence
- **Confidence Scoring**: Each classification includes 0-100% confidence score
- **Rationale**: Enterprise-grade taxonomy proven at scale, adapted for SMB teams
- **Trade-off**: Comprehensive analysis vs processing complexity

## **Deviation Decisions: Strategic Architectural Choices**

### **1. Simple File-Based Processing vs Enterprise Pipeline Complexity**
**Decision**: Direct file system processing instead of databases/APIs/message queues
- **Input Architecture**: Simple `/input/*.txt` file structure
- **Processing Flow**: Direct Claude Code execution without complex infrastructure
- **Output Generation**: File-based report creation with structured exports
- **Rationale**: Local execution environment eliminates need for enterprise infrastructure
- **Trade-off**: Simplicity and reliability vs concurrent user support

### **2. Complete Reprocessing vs Incremental Updates**
**Decision**: Full library reanalysis on each execution
- **Processing Strategy**: Analyze entire content library every run
- **Consistency Guarantee**: Always fresh, complete analysis without cache corruption
- **Debugging Simplicity**: Clear, predictable processing flow
- **Rationale**: Reliability over performance optimization for typical 30-100 video libraries
- **Trade-off**: Processing time vs consistency and simplicity

### **3. Text-Only Analysis vs Direct Multi-Modal Processing**
**Decision**: Process rich text summaries instead of handling images/video directly
- **Integration Pattern**: Expect preprocessed analysis from alexdev-video-summarizer
- **Content Format**: Rich multi-modal insights already converted to comprehensive text
- **Scalability Optimization**: Pure text processing enables rapid analysis of large libraries
- **Rationale**: Maximum analytical depth with optimal processing efficiency
- **Trade-off**: Dependency on preprocessor vs direct multi-modal complexity
