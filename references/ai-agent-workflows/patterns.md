## **Prompt Engineering Templates**

### **Content Classification Prompt Template**
```
You are an expert marketing strategist analyzing video content for strategic portfolio planning.

TAXONOMY FRAMEWORK:
Journey Stages: [Awareness, Consideration, Decision, Retention]
- Awareness: Problem identification, education about issues
- Consideration: Solution evaluation, comparing approaches  
- Decision: Vendor selection, product comparison, purchase decision
- Retention: Onboarding, optimization, expansion, renewal

Persona Types: [Technical Buyer, Business Buyer, End User, Champion]
- Technical Buyer: Evaluates technical fit, implementation requirements
- Business Buyer: Focuses on ROI, business impact, strategic alignment
- End User: Daily product usage, workflow integration, usability
- Champion: Internal advocate, change management, team adoption

Content Types: [Educational, Demo, Testimonial, Case Study]
Format Types: [Talking Head, Screen Demo, Animation, Live Action, Slides]

ANALYSIS PROCESS:
1. Read the transcript and examine key frames
2. Classify the content across all four dimensions
3. Provide confidence scores (0.0-1.0) for each classification
4. Include reasoning for classifications
5. Flag any ambiguous or edge cases

OUTPUT FORMAT:
{
  "journey_stage": "stage_name",
  "persona_primary": "persona_type",
  "content_type": "type_name", 
  "format": "format_type",
  "confidence_scores": {
    "journey_stage": 0.XX,
    "persona": 0.XX,
    "content_type": 0.XX,
    "format": 0.XX
  },
  "reasoning": "Brief explanation of classification decisions",
  "edge_cases": "Any ambiguity or uncertainty noted"
}
```

### **Gap Analysis Prompt Template**
```
You are a strategic marketing analyst creating actionable gap analysis from content inventory data.

PORTFOLIO DATA: [Content inventory with classifications and performance ratings]

ANALYSIS REQUIREMENTS:
1. Calculate distribution percentages across journey stages and personas
2. Identify gaps where content count is 0 or significantly below average
3. Weight gaps by performance data (prioritize high-performing categories with gaps)
4. Consider strategic importance (Decision stage gaps are typically higher priority)
5. Generate specific, actionable recommendations

OUTPUT STRUCTURE:
{
  "executive_summary": {
    "total_content": N,
    "critical_gaps": N,
    "coverage_score": "XX%"
  },
  "distribution_analysis": {
    "journey_stages": {...},
    "personas": {...},
    "content_types": {...}
  },
  "priority_gaps": [
    {
      "gap_description": "Specific gap identified",
      "impact_level": "high|medium|low",
      "content_count": N,
      "recommended_action": "Specific content creation recommendation"
    }
  ],
  "strategic_recommendations": [
    "Prioritized list of next steps"
  ]
}
```

## **Error Handling and Quality Patterns**

### **Pattern 4: Classification Validation Agent**
**Purpose**: Ensure consistency and accuracy across content classifications
**Implementation**: Quality assurance agent that reviews and validates classifications

```
Validation Process:
1. Cross-Content Consistency: Compare similar content for classification alignment
2. Confidence Threshold Checks: Flag low-confidence classifications for review
3. Edge Case Detection: Identify content that doesn't fit standard categories
4. Performance Correlation: Validate that high-performing content is properly classified
5. Human Review Triggers: Generate review queues for manual validation
```

### **Pattern 5: Progressive Enhancement**
**Purpose**: Improve classification accuracy through iterative refinement
**Implementation**: Learning agent that refines prompts and criteria over time

```
Enhancement Cycle:
1. Performance Monitoring: Track classification accuracy and user feedback
2. Pattern Recognition: Identify common misclassification patterns
3. Prompt Refinement: Update classification criteria and examples
4. A/B Testing: Compare different prompt variations
5. Continuous Improvement: Deploy enhanced prompts to production
```

## **Integration and Orchestration Patterns**

1. Content Fingerprinting: Generate unique identifiers for each video
2. Processing History: Track what has been analyzed and when
3. Delta Processing: Only analyze new or changed content
4. Batch Optimization: Group similar content for efficient processing
5. Recovery Mechanisms: Resume processing after interruptions
```

### **Pattern 9: Resource Management**
**Purpose**: Optimize token usage and processing time for cost efficiency
**Implementation**: Resource-aware processing with adaptive strategies

```
Resource Optimization:
1. Content Prioritization: Process high-value content first
2. Batch Size Optimization: Balance processing speed with resource usage
3. Confidence-Based Processing: Use simpler analysis for obvious classifications

5. Cost Monitoring: Track and optimize token consumption
```

## **Testing and Validation Patterns**

### **Pattern 10: Classification Accuracy Testing**
**Purpose**: Validate AI classification accuracy against human expert judgment
**Implementation**: Testing framework with ground truth validation

```
Testing Framework:
1. Expert Classification: Human experts classify sample content
2. AI Classification: Run same content through automated system
3. Accuracy Measurement: Compare AI vs human classifications
4. Error Analysis: Identify patterns in misclassifications
5. Prompt Refinement: Improve prompts based on error patterns
```

These patterns provide a comprehensive foundation for implementing enterprise-grade AI-powered content classification and strategic analysis systems.
